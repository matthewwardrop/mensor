Contributions
=============

Contributions of any nature are welcome, including software patches,
improvements to documentation, bug reports, or feature requests. Be aware,
however, that the project is still very much in flux and the original author's
full vision has yet to be realised, and so software patches that do not fit into
this vision may require significant reworking. If you would like to get involved,
it is probably a good idea to open a `GitHub issue <http://github.com/matthewwardrop/mensor>`_
first, and discuss how best to approach the task.
